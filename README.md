# Photography-Website
The first ever website I created in HTML & CSS as a course project
It's a website created for a fictive Photographer named Robbie Lens. 
The website contains three pages :
The home page, entiled 'Acceuil', contains her latest project, as well as a form to fill out.
The 'about' page, entitled 'A propos', contains a little more information about her profession, her passion for her work as well as the prices she offers. 
The 'Portfolio' page, as expected, contains her portfolio, consisting in particular of landscapes and portraits. 

It should be noted that I made this website in HTML and CSS, there is no backend. The form is therefore not sent anywhere.
